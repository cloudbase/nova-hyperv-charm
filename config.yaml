      Overwrite default installer location. Take care to set the correct openstack-version
      as that will be used by the charm to pick the correct config templates.
      If you use this option, you may enable file integrity checking by specifying
      an md5sum at the end of the URL as follows:

  # enable-cluster-driver:
  #   type: boolean

  #     Enables the Hyper-V compute driver for clustering. This requires at least two Hyper-V compute
  #     joined to a cluster.
  enable-multipath-io:

    default: False
    description: |
      Enable MPIO feature. This setting requires a restart.
  csv-performance-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      Represents the size in gigabytes occupied by the CSV requested from the s2d-proxy charm on
      the Performance tier. In a Hyper-Converged scenario, each nova-hyperv unit requests a CSV to
      store the virtual machines.
      When the above is requested from the s2d-proxy charm, if there's is enough available
      space in the Performance tier, the volume will be created.
      NOTE: If you optionally specify 'csv-capacity-size', then that requirement must be fullfiled
      as well.
  csv-capacity-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      Represents the size in gigabytes occupied by the CSV requested from the s2d-proxy charm on the Capacity tier.
      NOTE: Please, also look at the 'csv-performance-size' config option, above as these configuration options
      are used together.
  ovs-installer-url:
    type: string
    description: |
      Download URL of the OVS MSI installer.
  os-data-network:
    type: string
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the OpenStack Data network (e.g.: 192.168.0.0/24).
      This network will be used for tenant network traffic in overlay networks.
      NOTE: If ovs is selected as the network type, this option overrides
      data-port. OVS on Windows requires that the os data network be set on a NIC.
      That means that if an interface has an IP in the os-data-network
      range, that interface will be added to the vmswitch. There is a caveat here.
      If os-data-network is on a different interface then data-port, it might result
      in the hyper-v compute nodes not being able to use VLAN network segregation.
  rabbit-user:

  data-port:
    type: string
    description: |
      Ethernet interface to use for vmswitch. This can be a MAC address or an interface name.
      This option is mandatory if more then one interface is present on the target system.
      In cases where there is only one interface on the system, the vmswitch will be created using that
      interface and OSManagement will be set to True, regardless of the vmswitch-management option.
      Avoid using the management interface as a data interface where system has more then one NIC.
  vmswitch-name:
    type: string
    description: |
      Name of the Hyper-V virtual switch. Defaults to 'br100'.
  vmswitch-management:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Allow management OS on this vm switch. If True, the switch will be set in DHCP mode.
  log-dir:

      Log folder location. Defaults to '<system_drive_letter>:\OpenStack\Log'.
  instances-dir:
    type: string

      Defaults to '<system_drive_letter>:\OpenStack\Instances'.
  network-type:
    type: string
    default: hyperv
    description: |
      Neutron agent to use. Valid options are:
        * hyperv

  max-concurrent-live-migrations:

  limit-cpu-features:

    default: False
    description: |
      This flag is needed to support live migration to hosts with different
      CPU features and checked during instance creation in order to limit
      the CPU features used by the instance.
  cross-az-attach:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: |
      Allow Nova or not to attach Cinder volumes that are not in the same AZ
  change-hostname:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      The hostname set inside the newly spawned machine is usually the same as
      the name of the instance being spawned. In cases where the instance name
      is larger then 15 characters (maximum size for windows NetBios names), the
      instance name gets truncated to the first 15 characters. This creates a problem,
      as hostnames in active directory, for example, are very important. Having more
      then one machine with the same hostname try to join the same domain, will
      create trust issues.
      This option allows changing the hostname of the current running system to a
      combination of the first 14 (or less, depending on how many digits the unit number has)
      characters of the charm name and the unit number. While this is not infallible,
      It does have less of a chance of creating hostname conflicts.
  ssl-ca:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      base64-encoded SSL CA to use with the certificate and key provided -
      this is only required if you are providing a privately signed ssl_cert
      and ssl_key.
  format-raw-devices:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      When True will format and initialize all existing raw devices.
      It will not touch the OS drive or drives that already have a partition table.
