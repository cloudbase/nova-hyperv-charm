  csv-performance-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      Represents the size in gigabytes occupied by the CSV requested from the s2d-proxy charm on
      the Performance tier. In a Hyper-Converged scenario, each nova-hyperv unit requests a CSV to
      store the virtual machines.
      When the above is requested from the s2d-proxy charm, if there's is enough available
      space in the Performance tier, the volume will be created.
      NOTE: If you optionally specify 'csv-capacity-size', then that requirement must be fullfiled
      as well.
  csv-capacity-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      Represents the size in gigabytes occupied by the CSV requested from the s2d-proxy charm on the Capacity tier.
      NOTE: Please, also look at the 'csv-performance-size' config option, above as these configuration options
      are used together.

  cross-az-attach:

    default: True
    description: |

  change-hostname:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      The hostname set inside the newly spawned machine is usually the same as
      the name of the instance being spawned. In cases where the instance name
      is larger then 15 characters (maximum size for windows NetBios names), the
      instance name gets truncated to the first 15 characters. This creates a problem,
      as hostnames in active directory, for example, are very important. Having more
      then one machine with the same hostname try to join the same domain, will
      create trust issues.
      This option allows changing the hostname of the current running system to a
      combination of the first 14 (or less, depending on how many digits the unit number has)
      characters of the charm name and the unit number. While this is not infallible,
      It does have less of a chance of creating hostname conflicts.
